                <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
                <p>Save the migrant worker their family and improves there liveing condition around the different state of India.
                    We work to ensure all people of society have healthcare, food and shelter, as well as learning
                    and migrent worker protection services when worker need it most. We are committed to
                    helping all needy member of society achieve their full potential by ensuring they grow up healthy,
                    receive a good education,minimum day to day food and stay safe.

                    around India are denied their rights, simply because of who they are or where
                    they are from. We know that to ensure every person has the chance for a future
                    their rights must be upheld.Through our programming, emergency responses and advocacy,
                    we put the most vulnerable children first, tackling the barriers to survival,
                    learning and protection.

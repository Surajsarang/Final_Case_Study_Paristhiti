                    <h2> ROLE OF NGO </h2>
                    <p>The functions of NGO play a major role and have brought social change
                        for promotion and development of the society. It has proved that these
                        organisations are working for various parts of the world and are doing
                        their work in serving the humanity and other good cause. It is important
                        that the members of the NGO are educated, inspired, enthusiastic and working
                        in the interest  and properly carrying out the functions of NGO. The functions
                        of NGO deem to have a legal status as they are registered under the Societies
                        Registration Act, which is a Central Act for registering not for profit
                        registration. Thus, because of the functions of NGO in India it signifies
                        broad range of organisations which may be non-governmental, quasi or semi
                        governmental and includes both voluntary and non-voluntary organisation, etc.
                        NGO acts as a mediator between government and citizen. When few issues that
                        the does not reach to government or are not solved by the government then
                        functions of NGO play a significant role in assigning these issues to the
                        government and few issues are intentionally looked by the NGO. Their main
                        aim is to make the earth a better place for every human being who is
                        suffering.</p>
